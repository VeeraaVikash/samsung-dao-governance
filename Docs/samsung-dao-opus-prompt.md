# Samsung DAO Governance Platform — Full Build Prompt
> Use this prompt with Claude Opus. Feed it section by section or all at once depending on context window. Be specific when asking for each screen.

---

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

You are building **Samsung DAO Governance Portal** — an internal enterprise web application for Samsung Electronics employees, developed as part of the **Samsung PRISM** university research program.

This is a **decentralised governance platform** built on top of the **Hedera blockchain testnet**. It allows Samsung employees to participate in elections, vote on proposals, create governance events, and join giveaways — all governed by smart contracts on Hedera.

**This is an internal tool. It must look and feel like an official Samsung enterprise product — not a startup app, not a generic dashboard template. Every screen must be production-grade, polished, and professional.**

---

## ARCHITECTURE CONTEXT

The platform is split across two teams. You are building **Layers 1 and 2 only**.

```
Layer 1 — Samsung Member Web Portal      ← YOUR TEAM
  Next.js 14, Role-based UI, WalletConnect

Layer 2 — Identity & Access              ← YOUR TEAM
  Samsung SSO (OAuth 2.0 / JWT)
  KYC & Compliance (Identity Verification, Liveness Check)
  Verified Samsung Account (Enterprise Auth, Role Assignment)
  Wallet Service (Hedera Account Binding, Key Management)

Layer 3 — API Gateway & Rate Limiting    ← OTHER TEAM (mock for now)
  Governance Analytics Engine
  AI Anomaly Detection
  Snapshot Service
  Proposal Validator

Layer 4 — Smart Contracts (Hedera EVM/HTS/HCS)  ← OTHER TEAM
Layer 5 — Security & Governance Controls         ← OTHER TEAM
Layer 6 — Hedera Native Services                 ← OTHER TEAM
```

**For MVP: Mock all Layer 3–6 API calls with realistic dummy data. Build the UI and flows completely. Wire up real APIs later.**

## BUILD INSTRUCTIONS FOR OPUS

When building each screen, follow this order:

1. **Start with the layout shell** — Navbar, StatusBar, Sidebar (if authenticated screen), page wrapper
2. **Build the page-level components** — stat cards, main content cards, forms
3. **Add interactivity** — form state with React useState, tab switching, toggle state
4. **Add routing** — Next.js Link components between screens
5. **Use TypeScript interfaces** for all props and data shapes
6. **Mobile**: Build desktop-first. Sidebar collapses to hamburger on mobile. Cards stack vertically.

### Code quality rules:
- TypeScript strict mode
- No `any` types
- All components in separate files under `components/`
- Use Tailwind utility classes only — no inline styles except where Tailwind cannot reach
- shadcn/ui for: Button, Input, Select, Switch, Tabs, Badge, Card, Dialog, Table
- All colours must use the CSS variables or Tailwind config extensions — no hardcoded hex in JSX

### Tailwind config extensions needed:
```javascript
// tailwind.config.ts
extend: {
  colors: {
    samsung: {
      primary: '#1428A0',
      dark: '#0D1A7A',
      mid: '#4A5BD4',
      light: '#E8EAFB',
    }
  },
  fontFamily: {
    sans: ['IBM Plex Sans', 'system-ui', 'sans-serif'],
    mono: ['IBM Plex Mono', 'monospace'],
  }
}
```

## SAMPLE PROMPT TO START

Use this exact prompt in Opus to begin:

```
Build Phase 1 of the Samsung DAO Governance Platform using Next.js 14 (App Router), 
TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui.

Start with:
1. Project structure setup
2. Tailwind config with Samsung brand colors (#1428A0 primary) and IBM Plex Sans/Mono fonts
3. Navbar component (Samsung blue, 52px height, logo mark + portal name + testnet badge + user avatar)
4. StatusBar component (Hedera block height + system status, IBM Plex Mono)
5. Full Homepage page with 3 role selector cards (Admin, Council, Standard Member)

Follow the design system strictly:
- Light theme, white cards, #F8F9FC page background
- 0.5px borders, no shadows, no gradients
- Samsung blue #1428A0 for all primary actions
- IBM Plex Sans for UI, IBM Plex Mono for IDs/badges/labels

Produce complete, working TypeScript code for each file. No placeholders.
```
